## Challenge Election-Audit Summary
Based on the analysis conducted on the most recent congressional election, the code written for this analysis can be beneficial to routinely provide in-depth candidate and county data for future elections. This script can even be modified for use in any election by:
- Swapping out the county analysis for demographic, age, or gender analysis
- Building on the existing script with larger geographic data for large-scale elections, such as regions or states.
